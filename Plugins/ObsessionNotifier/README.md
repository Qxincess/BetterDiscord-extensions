# ObsessionNotifier

**About** : A plugin inspired by the idea of Dead By Daylight's obsession in game perks that alert about it position, etc. (Btw, Dead's man switch is wayyy too strong.)

How to : You paste your target's ID into the plugin configuration JSON or through the plugin settings and wait till your target sends a message, it should display the same as the picture provided below.
